# This repository is used to save several often used autounattend.xml scripts


Script #1
is just used as a "stick it in and let it install" or in military slang "fire and forget"
It adds no user, edits no settings.

Script #2
is used to install Windows for a random person with an Admin user added and some tweaks. 

Script #3
is purely to automate the max. Auto execution of several scripts.
