# This repository is used to save several often used autounattend.xml scripts

Just write an Windows 10/11 image to a medium and add one xml of your desire to its root.
Locale and network always has to be set manually. No bloatware is removed. Express settings are always ticked for 'minimum'.

Script #1
is just used as a "stick it in and let it install" or in military slang "fire and forget"
It adds no user, edits no settings. Wipes first drive and names it.

Script #2
is used to install Windows for any with an Admin user added (w/o password) and some tweaks. 

Script #3
is everything above plus it adds several useful scripts to the desktop after logging in the first time as the admin.

Scripts are downloaded to Admin user the first time it is logged in:
- ChrisTitus' WinUtil
- Massgraves Windows Activation Script
- Modified GamingAIO Script
- Office Plus (C2R script)
- Script to install and execute PSWindowsUpdate to ensure every update/ driver gets installed fast and properly
